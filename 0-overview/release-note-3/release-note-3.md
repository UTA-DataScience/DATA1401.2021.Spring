These series of notes have been extended to include Data Science topics that fulfill the requirements of the graduate course [PHYS 5391: Data Science With Python]({{ site.parent }}/DSP2019F/) offered in the fall of 2019 in the College of Science at The University of Texas at Arlington.  

The discussions of the section for Scientific Computing have now been expanded, some of which are now sections covering a range of topics, for example,  
1. plotting under the new category of visualization,  
1. random numbers, Monte Carlo, sampling and integration, under the new category of probabilistic modeling.
