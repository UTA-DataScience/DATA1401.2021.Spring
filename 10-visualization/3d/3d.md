## 3D-plotting in `matplotlib`  

Over the past few years `matplotlib` has significantly grown to include additional plotting capabilities including 3D plotting techniques. At this point in the Python learning process, it is generally more sensible to learn the latest techniques of the advanced Python packages (including `matplotlib`) directly from their reference manual. The reason for this is that the interfaces for many of these packages are constantly evolving and any code that may work today, may not be functional in a few months or years. With this note in mind, the following is a quick overview of some of these plotting functionalities.  


If you are using Jupyter notebooks as your primary interface to Python interpreter, consider adding `%matplotlib notebook` to the beginning of your Jupyter notebook. This **IPython magic** will make all the plots that will be generated in the notebook interactive, meaning that you will be able to zoom in and out, resize, or rotate the plots inside the notebook.


### Creating 3D figure objects  

To generate 3D figures, you will have to import `mpl_toolkits` Python package,  

```python
%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection="3d")

plt.show()
```

This should generate the following figure handle for you,

<figure>
    <img src="emptyFigure3D.png">
</figure>

To save the plot in an external file, use the `savefig()` method.  

```python
plt.savefig('emptyFigure3D.png')
```

### Creating 3D line plots  

Now suppose we want to visualize a 3D line which is described by the following equations,  

```python
import numpy as np
zmin = 0.0
zmax = 4*np.pi
LineZ = np.linspace(zmin, zmax, 500)
LineY = np.sin(LineZ)
LineX = np.cos(LineZ)
```

If you look carefully, you may notice that the X and Y coordinates described by the above equations describe a circular, repeating, line. On the contrary, the Z coordinates are described by a set of monotonically increasing values. Therefore, this 3D line must be describing a spring-like object. To plot this object, we can use the following,  

```python
%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection="3d")
ax.plot3D( x_line, y_line, z_line, 'gray')
plt.show()
plt.savefig('line3D.png')
```

which would give a plot like the following,  

<figure>
    <img src="line3D.png">
</figure>

### Creating 3D scatter plots  

Now, suppose we want to add a set of points to this line plot. For example, we could create a set of random points around the 3D line and visualize them, as if the random points are a set of observational data and the 3D line represents a mathemtical fit to this observational dataset,  

```python
import numpy as np
nPoint = 300 # number of random points
PointZ = zmin + (zmax-zmin) * np.random.random(nPoint)      # points have uniformly-distributed random heights along the Z axis
PointY = np.sin(PointZ) + 0.1 * np.random.randn(nPoint)     # points have normally-distributed random values along the Y axis
PointX = np.cos(PointZ) + 0.1 * np.random.randn(nPoint)     # points have normally-distributed random values along the X axis
ax.scatter3D( PointX, PointY, PointZ
            , c=PointZ      # color value of individual points is taken from their heights
            , cmap="hsv"    # the color mapping to be used. Other example options: winter, autumn, ...
            );
plt.show()
plt.savefig('lineScatter3D.png')
```

<figure>
    <img src="lineScatter3D.png">
</figure>

To get a full list of all color-maps that you can use and information about them, try,  

```python
help(plt.colormaps)
```
    Help on function colormaps in module matplotlib.pyplot:

    colormaps()
        Matplotlib provides a number of colormaps, and others can be added using
        :func:`~matplotlib.cm.register_cmap`.  This function documents the built-in
        colormaps, and will also return a list of all registered colormaps if
        called.
        
        You can set the colormap for an image, pcolor, scatter, etc,
        using a keyword argument::
        
          imshow(X, cmap=cm.hot)
        
        or using the :func:`set_cmap` function::
        
          imshow(X)
          pyplot.set_cmap('hot')
          pyplot.set_cmap('jet')
        
        In interactive mode, :func:`set_cmap` will update the colormap post-hoc,
        allowing you to see which one works best for your data.
        
        All built-in colormaps can be reversed by appending ``_r``: For instance,
        ``gray_r`` is the reverse of ``gray``.
        
        There are several common color schemes used in visualization:
        
        Sequential schemes
          for unipolar data that progresses from low to high
        Diverging schemes
          for bipolar data that emphasizes positive or negative deviations from a
          central value
        Cyclic schemes
          for plotting values that wrap around at the endpoints, such as phase
          angle, wind direction, or time of day
        Qualitative schemes
          for nominal data that has no inherent ordering, where color is used
          only to distinguish categories
        
        Matplotlib ships with 4 perceptually uniform color maps which are
        the recommended color maps for sequential data:

### Creating 3D wire plots  

Now suppose we have a 3D mathematical function that defines a surface in 3D, such as the following,  

```python
import numpy as np
def getZ(X, Y):
    return np.sin(np.sqrt(X ** 2 + Y ** 2))

X = np.linspace(-5, 5, 40)
Y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 40)

X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
Z = getZ(X, Y)
```

With the three mesh grids `(X,Y,Z)` generated in the above, we can now visualize this 3D function via a wire plot like the following,  

```python
%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection="3d")

ax.plot_wireframe(X, Y, Z, color='red')
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_zlabel('Z')
plt.show()
plt.savefig('wire3D.png')
```

which will generate the following plot,  

<figure>
    <img src="wire3D.png">
</figure>

### Creating 3D surface plots  

Now suppose we want to visualize the surface of the same function as in the case of the wire plot,  

```python
import numpy as np
def getZ(X, Y):
    return np.sin(np.sqrt(X ** 2 + Y ** 2))

X = np.linspace(-5, 5, 40)
Y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 40)

X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
Z = getZ(X, Y)

%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection="3d")

ax.plot_surface (X, Y, Z
                , rstride=1 # default value is one
                , cstride=1 # default value is one
                , cmap='winter'
                , edgecolor='none'
                )
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_zlabel('Z')
ax.set_title('Surface Plot');
plt.show()
plt.savefig('surface3D.png')
```

This will generate the following plot,  

<figure>
    <img src="surface3D.png">
</figure>

However, you may have noticed that this plot looks very coarse. To refine the image, we can increase the number of grids in the 3D mesh that we generate for the visualization. Instead of using 40 grids as used previously, we will use a larger number, for example, 300,  

```python
import numpy as np
def getZ(X, Y):
    return np.sin(np.sqrt(X ** 2 + Y ** 2))

X = np.linspace(-5, 5, 300)
Y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 300)

X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
Z = getZ(X, Y)

%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection="3d")

ax.plot_surface (X, Y, Z
                , rstride=1 # default value is one
                , cstride=1 # default value is one
                , cmap='winter'
                , edgecolor='none'
                )
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_zlabel('Z')
ax.set_title('Fine-Mesh Surface Plot');
plt.show()
plt.savefig('refinedSurface3D.png')
```

The resulting surface plot now looks much more refined and pleasant,  

<figure>
    <img src="refinedSurface3D.png">
</figure>

### Creating contour plots  

The 3D surface or wire plots have limited usage because of their difficult interpretations, especially when they presented as fixed static images as opposed to interactive live plots. A more useful 3D plotting technique, in particular, for scientific reports is the contour plotting. Suppose we have a very weird-looking 3D function which is hard to visualize via a surface plot,  

```python
import numpy as np
def func(x, y):
    return np.sin(x) ** 5 + np.cos(10 + y * x) * np.cos(x)
```

We can visualize this function via a contour plot by creating mesh grid of the coordinates again,  

```python
import numpy as np
def func(X, Y):
    return np.sin(X) ** 5 + np.cos(10 + Y * X) * np.cos(X)
X = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
Y = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
Z = func(X, Y)

%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes()

ax.contour(X, Y, Z, colors='gray');
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
plt.show()
plt.savefig('contour.png')
```

<figure>
    <img src="contour.png">
</figure>

We could also change the color from uniform gray to a more descriptive color-map instead,  

```python
import numpy as np
def func(X, Y):
    return np.sin(X) ** 5 + np.cos(10 + Y * X) * np.cos(X)
X = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
Y = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
Z = func(X, Y)

%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d

ax = plt.axes()

ax.contour  (X, Y, Z
            , cmap = 'RdGy'
            );

ax.set_ylabel('y')

or perhaps `autumn` color-map,  

```python
import numpy as np
def func(X, Y):
    return np.sin(X) ** 5 + np.cos(10 + Y * X) * np.cos(X)
X = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
Y = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
Z = func(X, Y)

%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes()

ax.contour  (X, Y, Z
            , cmap = plt.cm.autumn
            );
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
plt.show()
plt.savefig('contourColorMapAutumn.png')
```

### Creating filled contour plots  

But what if we are interested not in contour lines, but an overall behavior of the function everywhere, womething like a heat-map? There is the `contourf()` method there to help us,  

```python
import numpy as np
def func(X, Y):
    return np.sin(X) ** 5 + np.cos(10 + Y * X) * np.cos(X)
X = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
Y = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
Z = func(X, Y)

%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes()

ax.contourf (X, Y, Z
            , 20    # the number of color levels in the heat-map
            , cmap = "RdGy"
            );
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
plt.show()
plt.savefig('contourf.png')
```

<figure>
    <img src="contourf.png">
</figure>

You may again notice the low-resolution of the plot. To refine the plot, we can increase the number of color-levels in the plot, for example to 100 from 20,  

```python
import numpy as np
def func(X, Y):
    return np.sin(X) ** 5 + np.cos(10 + Y * X) * np.cos(X)
X = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
Y = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
Z = func(X, Y)

%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes()

ax.contourf (X, Y, Z
            , 100    # the number of color levels in the heat-map
            , cmap = "RdGy"
            );
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
plt.show()
plt.savefig('contourfRefined.png')
```

<figure>
    <img src="contourfRefined.png">
</figure>

However, refining filled contour plots by increasing the number of color levels could affect the performance of our script. Another way to achieve the same goal is to use another plotting method called `imshow()` instead of `contourf()`,  

```python
import numpy as np
def func(X, Y):
    return np.sin(X) ** 5 + np.cos(10 + Y * X) * np.cos(X)
X = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
Y = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 500)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
Z = func(X, Y)

%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes()

plt.imshow( Z
          , extent=[0, 2*np.pi, 0, 2*np.pi] # doesn't accept X and Y grids, so you must manually specify the extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] of the image on the plot
          , origin='lower' # default origin of the plot is the upper-left
          , cmap='RdGy'
          )
plt.colorbar()
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
plt.show()
plt.savefig('imshow.png')
```

<figure>
    <img src="imshow.png">
</figure>

Notice the additional color bar that we have added to the above plot via the command `plt.colorbar()`.
